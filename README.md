# ASP.NET MVC Fluent Routing 

ASP.NET MVC Fluent Routing is a thin wrapper around the ASP.NET MVC attribute routing engine. With Fluent Routing you can define your routes using a fluent interface, but with the full power of the attribute routing engine (inline route constraints, optional URI parameters and default values). 

## Where can I get it?

Open the Visual Studio Package Manager Console and run the following command:

``
Install-Package FluentRouting.Mvc
``
